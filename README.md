# Problem Statement
Malaysian university students, particularly at UMPSA, face significant barriers to accessing affordable and accessible academic support:

## Core Problems:
1. Financial Barriers:
   Private tutoring in Malaysia averages RM47/hour, with specialized university-level tutoring ranging from RM80-200/hour, making it unaffordable for most students from middle and lower-income families.
   
2. Academic System Complexity:
   Malaysia's diverse educational pathways (STPM, Matriculation, A-Levels, Foundation, Diploma) create confusion when students transition to university, with limited unified academic support addressing these different backgrounds.
   
3. Lack of Peer Learning Platforms:
   Despite research showing peer tutoring can improve learning outcomes significantly, no dedicated platforms exist for Malaysian university students to connect with high-performing peers for academic assistance.
   
4. Immediate Academic Emergency Support:
   Students often need urgent help with assignments, exam preparation, or concept clarification outside of regular academic hours, but traditional support systems are not readily available.

# Supporting Evidence
## Financial Constraints:
- UMPSA program costs: RM7,380-8,680 for degree programs
- Students pay RM860-1,510 per semester for tuition
- Additional private tutoring at RM80-200/hour would cost RM1,600-4,000 extra per semester
- This represents a 186-470% increase in education costs for families

## System Fragmentation:
- 6 different pre-university pathways feeding into Malaysian universities
- 4 major languages in Malaysian education: English, Bahasa Malaysia, Mandarin, Tamil
- 43 public universities + 80+ private universities with varying syllabi
- No existing platform specifically addresses Malaysian academic system complexity

## Peer Learning Gap:
- Current tutoring platforms focus on professional tutors rather than peer-to-peer learning
- High-achieving students lack opportunities to monetize their academic expertise
- No incentive systems exist to encourage consistent peer academic support
